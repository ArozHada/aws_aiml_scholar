#Intelligent Document Querying System on AWS

Final AWS Bedrock RAG project as a part of the AWS AI&ML Scholars Fellowship

Create an intelligent document querying system, showcasing the real-world applications of generative AI by building a GenAI RAG solution using:
- AWS Bedrock: AWS service to run LLMs 
- Aurora Postgres Serverless: A scalable, serverless database to efficiently store and manage your data.
- Amazon S3: Object storage for housing your document corpus.

This project simulates a real-world scenario where organizations need to make vast amounts of documentation searchable and accessible through natural language interfaces.
- Ingest and store documents
- Process and index this information for AI consumption
- Use Bedrock's language models to understand and respond to queries about the stored information
- Apply measures to secure the GenAI pipeline
